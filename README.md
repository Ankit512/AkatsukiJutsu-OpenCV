The Akatsuki was a group of S-ranked criminals who originated from different places in the world of Naruto. Although the Akatsuki featured an all-star list of characters, they had a mighty Jutsu that required the power of all of their members to work efficiently. This Jutsu, known as the Nine Phantom Dragons, was a technique that could forcibly extract Tailed Beasts from within a JinchÅ«riki, and was thus, truly a Jutsu worth the powers of all the members of the organization. According to Zetsu, this technique took a while longer to work with fewer members, although it still got the job done. It has been speculated that this Jutsu would only work if one of the members possesses the Rinnegan since it employs the use of the Outer Path Statue.
